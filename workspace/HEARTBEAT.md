# Heartbeat Tasks

This file is checked every 30 minutes by your nanobot agent.
Add tasks below that you want the agent to work on periodically.

If this file has no tasks (only headers and comments), the agent will skip the heartbeat.

> **Note**: If a task needs to send you a message, it will use the `message` tool.
> See AGENTS.md for details on cron task message delivery.
